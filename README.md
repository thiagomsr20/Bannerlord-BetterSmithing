## 📜 Introduction
I have always loved medieval-themed games, and *Mount & Blade: Warband* was the best game I have ever played in this genre. Its successor, *Mount & Blade: Bannerlord*, has quickly become one of my favorites. 

One of the many mechanics in the game is the **Smithing system**, which allows you to craft weapons, refine metals, or melt down weapons obtained as loot or purchased from city markets.

## ⚔️ The Problem
When crafting or melting a small number of items, clicking once per item to execute the action is not a big deal. However, the issue arises when you need to **craft or melt a large number of items**. The game does not offer a functionality to hold **CTRL + click** to execute multiple actions at once (which, honestly, it should, as this is a basic feature).

This problem made my gameplay frustrating, as my character played the role of a blacksmith, meaning I frequently crafted or melted down many items to extract materials. 

## 🛠️ The Solution
To solve this issue, I researched mod development for the game and discovered that it uses my favorite language, **C#**. Motivated by this, I started learning how to create a mod and publish it on Steam, making my gameplay experience much smoother and more enjoyable.
