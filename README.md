Bannerlord Mod for Creating Batch Items

Introduction

I have always loved medieval-themed games, and Mount & Blade: Warband was the best game I have ever played in this genre. Its successor, Mount & Blade: Bannerlord, has quickly become one of my favorites.

One of the many mechanics in the game is the Smithing system, which allows you to craft weapons, refine metals, or melt down weapons obtained as loot or purchased from city markets.

The Problem

When crafting or melting a small number of items, clicking once per item to execute the action is not a big deal. However, the issue arises when you need to craft or melt a large number of items. The game does not offer a functionality to hold CTRL + click to execute multiple actions at once (which, honestly, it should, as this is a basic feature).

This problem made my gameplay frustrating, as my character played the role of a blacksmith, meaning I frequently crafted or melted down many items to extract materials.

The Solution

To solve this issue, I researched mod development for the game and discovered that it uses my favorite language, C#. Motivated by this, I started learning how to create a mod and publish it on Steam, making my gameplay experience much smoother and more enjoyable.

This mod was created to improve the smithing experience in Bannerlord by allowing batch crafting and melting of items, eliminating the need for excessive clicking.

Stay tuned for updates and improvements!
